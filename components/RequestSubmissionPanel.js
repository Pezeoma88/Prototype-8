// Shows where a Submit Ride Request stands, on the ride it was sent to.
// `submission` is App's requestSubmission state; its `phase` is one of:
//   submitting   waiting for the server's answer (can be abandoned)
//   checking     no answer came back, so the app is asking the server what
//                it holds (after abandoning, a timeout, or a network error)
//   success      the server confirmed a Pending request
//   arrived      the rider stopped waiting, but the request had already
//                been saved: they choose to keep or withdraw it
//   existing     the rider already had a request here that isn't Pending
//                (accepted, denied, or cancelled); nothing was changed
//   refused      the server answered "no" and saved nothing
//   not_found    several checks found no request on the server
//   unknown      the server couldn't be reached to check
//   withdrawing  cancelling a request that had arrived
//
// The wording only ever states what the server confirmed. In particular it
// never says a request was cancelled just because the rider stopped waiting.
